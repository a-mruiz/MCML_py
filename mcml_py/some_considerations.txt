The coordinate systems used always consider z=0 at the start of the tissue layer, this means that the lightsources will have negative z coordinate !!!!

TODO:
    -Implement this method in a HS manner
    -Implement this method for multiple lightsources
    -Implement this method for rounded geometries of skin
    -Implement this method for more complex geometries
